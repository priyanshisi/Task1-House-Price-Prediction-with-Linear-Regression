# Task1-House-Price-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression
This repository contains a machine learning model implemented using linear regression to predict house prices based on a set of features. The model has been trained on a dataset of real estate listings, and its performance has been evaluated using various metrics.

**Dataset**
1. **num_rooms**: This column likely represents the number of rooms in each house. It is a discrete numerical feature.
2. **object_type_name**: This column describe the type or category of the object, possibly indicating whether the property is a house, apartment, etc. It is a categorical feature.
3. **price**: This is the target variable you want to predict - the price of the houses. It is a continuous numerical variable.
4. **water_percentage_1000**: the percentage of water coverage within a certain radius of the property. It is a numerical feature.
5. **travel_time_private_transport**: The travel time (in minutes) using private transportation to reach certain amenities or locations. It is a numerical feature.
6. **travel_time_public_transport**: Similar to the previous feature,  the travel time using public transportation.
7. **number_of_buildings_in_hectare**: This feature represents the count of buildings within a certain area (hectare).
8. **number_of_apartments_in_hectare**: This indicates the count of apartments within a certain area (hectare).
9. **number_of_workplaces_in_hectare**: This  represents the count of workplaces within a certain area (hectare).
10. **number_of_workplaces_sector_1_in_hectare**: This  specify the count of workplaces in a particular sector (e.g., industry sector) within a certain area.
11. **number_of_workplaces_sector_2_in_hectare**: Similar to the previous feature, this represents workplaces in another sector within a certain area.
12. **number_of_workplaces_sector_3_in_hectare**: This likely refers to workplaces in a third sector within a certain area.
13. **population_in_hectare**: This feature represent the population count within a certain area (hectare).

**Usage**
Open the Jupyter Notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb.
Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
Experiment with different features or hyperparameters for better results.
